# virus_modeling

the main work is done on a high performance computing cluster. submission scripts are in /scripts/. To run these, you would either need to access the same HPC architecture (email: dtalmy@utk.edu), or the scripts would need to be modified for whichever arcitecture you are using

the output is stored in /data/ and source to generate the main figures in the paper from these outputs are in /src/

finally, if you would like to test the model on your local computer, you can do so by running the /scr/test_models.py file
